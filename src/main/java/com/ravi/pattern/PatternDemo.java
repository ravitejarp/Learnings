	/**
	 * Open Declaration java.util.regex.Pattern
	 * 
	 * 
	 * A compiled representation of a regular expression.
	 * 
	 * A regular expression, specified as a string, must first be compiled into
	 * an instance of this class. The resulting pattern can then be used to
	 * create a Matcher object that can match arbitrary character sequences
	 * against the regular expression. All of the state involved in performing a
	 * match resides in the matcher, so many matchers can share the same
	 * pattern.
	 * 
	 * A typical invocation sequence is thus
	 * 
	 * Pattern p = Pattern.compile("a*b"); Matcher m = p.matcher("aaaaab");
	 * boolean b = m.matches(); A matches method is defined by this class as a
	 * convenience for when a regular expression is used just once. This method
	 * compiles an expression and matches an input sequence against it in a
	 * single invocation. The statement
	 * 
	 * boolean b = Pattern.matches("a*b", "aaaaab"); is equivalent to the three
	 * statements above, though for repeated matches it is less efficient since
	 * it does not allow the compiled pattern to be reused. Instances of this
	 * class are immutable and are safe for use by multiple concurrent threads.
	 * Instances of the Matcher class are not safe for such use.

	 * 
	 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
	 * --------
	 * 
	 * Backslashes, escapes, and quoting The backslash character ('\') serves to
	 * introduce escaped constructs, as defined in the table above, as well as
	 * to quote characters that otherwise would be interpreted as unescaped
	 * constructs. Thus the expression \\ matches a single backslash and \{
	 * matches a left brace.
	 * 
	 * It is an error to use a backslash prior to any alphabetic character that
	 * does not denote an escaped construct; these are reserved for future
	 * extensions to the regular-expression language. A backslash may be used
	 * prior to a non-alphabetic character regardless of whether that character
	 * is part of an unescaped construct.
	 * 
	 * Backslashes within string literals in Java source code are interpreted as
	 * required by The Java Language Specification as either Unicode escapes
	 * (section 3.3) or other character escapes (section 3.10.6) It is therefore
	 * necessary to double backslashes in string literals that represent regular
	 * expressions to protect them from interpretation by the Java bytecode
	 * compiler. The string literal "\b", for example, matches a single
	 * backspace character when interpreted as a regular expression, while "\\b"
	 * matches a word boundary. The string literal "\(hello\)" is illegal and
	 * leads to a compile-time error; in order to match the string (hello) the
	 * string literal "\\(hello\\)" must be used.
	 * 
	 * Character Classes Character classes may appear within other character
	 * classes, and may be composed by the union operator (implicit) and the
	 * intersection operator (&&). The union operator denotes a class that
	 * contains every character that is in at least one of its operand classes.
	 * The intersection operator denotes a class that contains every character
	 * that is in both of its operand classes.
	 * 
	 * The precedence of character-class operators is as follows, from highest
	 * to lowest:
	 * 
	 * 1 Literal escape \x 2 Grouping [...] 3 Range a-z 4 Union [a-e][i-u] 5
	 * Intersection [a-z&&[aeiou]]
	 * 
	 * Note that a different set of metacharacters are in effect inside a
	 * character class than outside a character class. For instance, the regular
	 * expression . loses its special meaning inside a character class, while
	 * the expression - becomes a range forming metacharacter.
	 * 
	 * Line terminators A line terminator is a one- or two-character sequence
	 * that marks the end of a line of the input character sequence. The
	 * following are recognized as line terminators:
	 * 
	 * A newline (line feed) character ('\n'), A carriage-return character
	 * followed immediately by a newline character ("\r\n"), A standalone
	 * carriage-return character ('\r'), A next-line character ('\u0085'), A
	 * line-separator character ('\u2028'), or A paragraph-separator character
	 * ('\u2029). If UNIX_LINES mode is activated, then the only line
	 * terminators recognized are newline characters.
	 * 
	 * The regular expression . matches any character except a line terminator
	 * unless the DOTALL flag is specified.
	 * 
	 * By default, the regular expressions ^ and $ ignore line terminators and
	 * only match at the beginning and the end, respectively, of the entire
	 * input sequence. If MULTILINE mode is activated then ^ matches at the
	 * beginning of input and after any line terminator except at the end of
	 * input. When in MULTILINE mode $ matches just before a line terminator or
	 * the end of the input sequence.
	 * 
	 * Groups and capturing Group number Capturing groups are numbered by
	 * counting their opening parentheses from left to right. In the expression
	 * ((A)(B(C))), for example, there are four such groups:
	 * 
	 * 1 ((A)(B(C))) 2 (A) 3 (B(C)) 4 (C)
	 * 
	 * Group zero always stands for the entire expression.
	 * 
	 * Capturing groups are so named because, during a match, each subsequence
	 * of the input sequence that matches such a group is saved. The captured
	 * subsequence may be used later in the expression, via a back reference,
	 * and may also be retrieved from the matcher once the match operation is
	 * complete.
	 * 
	 * Group name A capturing group can also be assigned a "name", a
	 * named-capturing group, and then be back-referenced later by the "name".
	 * Group names are composed of the following characters. The first character
	 * must be a letter.
	 * 
	 * The uppercase letters 'A' through 'Z' ('\u0041' through '\u005a'), The
	 * lowercase letters 'a' through 'z' ('\u0061' through '\u007a'), The digits
	 * '0' through '9' ('\u0030' through '\u0039'), A named-capturing group is
	 * still numbered as described in Group number.
	 * 
	 * The captured input associated with a group is always the subsequence that
	 * the group most recently matched. If a group is evaluated a second time
	 * because of quantification then its previously-captured value, if any,
	 * will be retained if the second evaluation fails. Matching the string
	 * "aba" against the expression (a(b)?)+, for example, leaves group two set
	 * to "b". All captured input is discarded at the beginning of each match.
	 * 
	 * Groups beginning with (? are either pure, non-capturing groups that do
	 * not capture text and do not count towards the group total, or
	 * named-capturing group.
	 * 
	 * Unicode support This class is in conformance with Level 1 of Unicode
	 * Technical Standard #18: Unicode Regular Expression, plus RL2.1 Canonical
	 * Equivalents.
	 * 
	 * Unicode escape sequences such as \u2014 in Java source code are processed
	 * as described in section 3.3 of The Java Language Specification. Such
	 * escape sequences are also implemented directly by the regular-expression
	 * parser so that Unicode escapes can be used in expressions that are read
	 * from files or from the keyboard. Thus the strings "\u2014" and "\\u2014",
	 * while not equal, compile into the same pattern, which matches the
	 * character with hexadecimal value 0x2014.
	 * 
	 * A Unicode character can also be represented in a regular-expression by
	 * using its Hex notation(hexadecimal code point value) directly as
	 * described in construct \x{...}, for example a supplementary character
	 * U+2011F can be specified as \x{2011F}, instead of two consecutive Unicode
	 * escape sequences of the surrogate pair \uD840\uDD1F.
	 * 
	 * Unicode scripts, blocks, categories and binary properties are written
	 * with the \p and \P constructs as in Perl. \p{prop} matches if the input
	 * has the property prop, while \P{prop} does not match if the input has
	 * that property.
	 * 
	 * Scripts, blocks, categories and binary properties can be used both inside
	 * and outside of a character class.
	 * 
	 * Scripts are specified either with the prefix Is, as in IsHiragana, or by
	 * using the script keyword (or its short form sc)as in script=Hiragana or
	 * sc=Hiragana.
	 * 
	 * The script names supported by Pattern are the valid script names accepted
	 * and defined by UnicodeScript.forName.
	 * 
	 * Blocks are specified with the prefix In, as in InMongolian, or by using
	 * the keyword block (or its short form blk) as in block=Mongolian or
	 * blk=Mongolian.
	 * 
	 * The block names supported by Pattern are the valid block names accepted
	 * and defined by UnicodeBlock.forName.
	 * 
	 * Categories may be specified with the optional prefix Is: Both \p{L}} and
	 * \p{IsL}} denote the category of Unicode letters. Same as scripts and
	 * blocks, categories can also be specified by using the keyword
	 * general_category (or its short form gc) as in general_category=Lu or
	 * gc=Lu.
	 * 
	 * The supported categories are those of The Unicode Standard in the version
	 * specified by the Character class. The category names are those defined in
	 * the Standard, both normative and informative.
	 * 
	 * Binary properties are specified with the prefix Is, as in IsAlphabetic.
	 * The supported binary properties by Pattern are
	 * 
	 * Alphabetic Ideographic Letter Lowercase Uppercase Titlecase Punctuation
	 * Control White_Space Digit Hex_Digit Join_Control Noncharacter_Code_Point
	 * Assigned The following Predefined Character classes and POSIX character
	 * classes are in conformance with the recommendation of Annex C:

	 * character: [\p{Graph}\p{Blank}&&[^\p{Cntrl}]]} \p{Blank} A space or a
	 * tab: [\p{IsWhite_Space}&&[^\p{gc=Zl}\p{gc=Zp}\x0a\x0b\x0c\x0d\x85]]}
	 * \p{Cntrl} A control character: \p{gc=Cc} \p{XDigit} A hexadecimal digit:
	 * [\p{gc=Nd}\p{IsHex_Digit}] \p{Space} A whitespace
	 * character:\p{IsWhite_Space} \d A digit: \p{IsDigit} \D A non-digit: [^\d]
	 * \s A whitespace character: \p{IsWhite_Space} \S A non-whitespace
	 * character: [^\s] \w A word character:
	 * [\p{Alpha}\p{gc=Mn}\p{gc=Me}\p{gc=Mc
	 * }\p{Digit}\p{gc=Pc}\p{IsJoin_Control}] \W A non-word character: [^\w]
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Categories that behave like the java.lang.Character boolean ismethodname
	 * methods (except for the deprecated ones) are available through the same
	 * \p{prop} syntax where the specified property has the name javamethodname.
	 * 
	 * Comparison to Perl 5 The Pattern engine performs traditional NFA-based
	 * matching with ordered alternation as occurs in Perl 5.
	 * 
	 * Perl constructs not supported by this class:
	 * 
	 * Predefined character classes (Unicode character)
	 * 
	 * \X Match Unicode extended grapheme cluster
	 * 
	 * The backreference constructs, \g{n} for the nthcapturing group and
	 * \g{name} for named-capturing group.
	 * 
	 * The named character construct, \N{name} for a Unicode character by its
	 * name.
	 * 
	 * The conditional constructs (?(condition)X) and (?(condition)X|Y),
	 * 
	 * The embedded code constructs (?{code}) and (??{code}),
	 * 
	 * The embedded comment syntax (?#comment), and
	 * 
	 * The preprocessing operations \l \\u, \L, and \U.
	 * 
	 * Constructs supported by this class but not by Perl:
	 * 
	 * Character-class union and intersection as described above.
	 * 
	 * Notable differences from Perl:
	 * 
	 * In Perl, \1 through \9 are always interpreted as back references; a
	 * backslash-escaped number greater than 9 is treated as a back reference if
	 * at least that many subexpressions exist, otherwise it is interpreted, if
	 * possible, as an octal escape. In this class octal escapes must always
	 * begin with a zero. In this class, \1 through \9 are always interpreted as
	 * back references, and a larger number is accepted as a back reference if
	 * at least that many subexpressions exist at that point in the regular
	 * expression, otherwise the parser will drop digits until the number is
	 * smaller or equal to the existing number of groups or it is one digit.
	 * 
	 * Perl uses the g flag to request a match that resumes where the last match
	 * left off. This functionality is provided implicitly by the Matcher class:
	 * Repeated invocations of the find method will resume where the last match
	 * left off, unless the matcher is reset.
	 * 
	 * In Perl, embedded flags at the top level of an expression affect the
	 * whole expression. In this class, embedded flags always take effect at the
	 * point at which they appear, whether they are at the top level or within a
	 * group; in the latter case, flags are restored at the end of the group
	 * just as in Perl.
	 *
